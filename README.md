# Exploratory Data Analysis and Logistic Regression in Python

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Logistic Regression repository! This repository contains Python code and resources for performing exploratory data analysis on datasets using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, and implementing logistic regression for classification tasks.

## Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in the data analysis process, allowing us to understand the underlying patterns, trends, and relationships in the data before building predictive models. In this repository, we use Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to explore and visualize the dataset.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: We perform data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and dealing with outliers to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: We utilize Matplotlib to create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to gain insights into the data distribution and relationships between variables.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: We compute descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles to summarize the dataset's central tendency and dispersion.
- **Logistic Regression**: We implement logistic regression, a popular machine learning algorithm for binary classification, to predict the outcome variable based on the input features. Our goal is to achieve an accuracy of 80% or higher on the dataset after initial analysis and data cleaning.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (optional for logistic regression implementation)
